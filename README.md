# LeetCode's 'Trapping Rain Water' in Rust
I solved LeetCode's HARD ['Trapping Rain Water' problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/), completely on my own! It took HOURS of tiring work, but I persevered and now I'm here. My solution is VERY VERY slow, at 1315 ms runtime, but as I said I did everything on my own, so I'm really proud.

## Backstory
A long time ago, my friend Agamyan and I were participating in a programming contest at school. We were going to be programming in Python, and we would spend hours each day at school solving LeetCode problems. We eventually found this problem and started trying to solve it in Python. It was hard, and I got to the same stage as I did last nightâ€” my code passed the first test case but not the second. That's when our teacher walked in saying the problems would be way easier than this and we didn't have to waste time on this problem. So, we stopped working on it. Eventually came the day of the contest, and there were only two problems, both of which were very easy. [Agamyan and I solved them](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=665474542263992&set=pb.100064043553353.-2207520000&type=3) effortlessly, and made our programs as sophisticated as we could, with validation, memory conservation, and such. Therefore we also ended up winning the contest, placing first.

A few weeks ago I started learning Rust, and over the past few days I've been solving LeetCode problems in Rust. I stumbled upon this problem, and felt a sudden surge of motivation which drove me not to stop until I solved it, and I did!

## Approach
In the beginning, I had no idea whatsoever where to start, but then some approaches started coming to my mind. By last night (I started yesterday evening, i.e. Nov 16, 2023) I had my code working for the first test case that LeetCode provides, but not for the second one.

This morning while showering to get ready for school, I thought about this and came up with an idea. I implemented that and after just a few hours of debugging, my code was working! I was really happy, because my code even worked with [a test case that I created](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVad9QU834tdYvtRYDS0fPmuFm0sT1x7lHCuMXmXKWo/edit?usp=sharing))!

## Conclusion
After submitting this solution and acknowledging my code's terrible performance, I checked out some code samples that used 0 ms. They are fascinating. I had to write so many long functions and people are out there writing the entire solution with just 30 lines of code tops. So yeah, my solution is definitely not the most efficient, but it's what makes the most sense to me, and of course, it makes me proud for solving this problem entirely on my own.
